room1_puzzle1,Room 1,Memory Bush (Leveled Sequence),Bush-shaped prop with ~10 white buttons on hand-like branches. Lights flash in a sequence; players must repeat. Three levels (easy→hard) increase sequence length.,"memory,sequence,bush,buttons,levels",Watch the entire sequence before you press any buttons.,"Break long sequences into smaller chunks (e.g., 3 then 3).",Use rhythm or count beats to help memorize the order.,"If you fail, re-observe the sequence once more — don’t rush.",https://youtube.com/shorts/49JLGtVF5uc?feature=share,3,4,
room1_puzzle2,Room 1,Color Memory Trees,"Two freestanding trees with colorful cards (red, green, blue, purple). A flower-tapper is used to select colors; players must match cards across both trees.","color memory,trees,cards,matching,flower tapper",Memorize one color at a time and match that color across both trees.,Start with the color that appears most frequently — it reduces options.,Systematically clear one tree then the other to avoid back-and-forth confusion.,"Use visual anchors (top-left, bottom-right) to recall positions.",https://youtube.com/shorts/49JLGtVF5uc?feature=share,2,3,
room1_puzzle3,Room 1,Emotions Tree (Sound→Face),A tree of clock-like faces showing different emotions; pressing a face plays an emotion sound. Players must match each sound to the correct face.,"emotion,sound,faces,match,clock",Listen to the FULL sound before choosing a face — tone carries key info.,Compare multiple facial features (eyes + mouth) to disambiguate similar expressions.,"If two faces look very alike, use process of elimination by matching other, clearer sounds first.",Press gently and give the sound space to finish before answering.,https://youtube.com/shorts/49JLGtVF5uc?feature=share,3,4,
room1_puzzle4,Room 1,Bells (Audio Sequence),A panel of bells; one bell plays a sequence of 5 (or more at higher difficulty) tones which players must reproduce using the other bells.,"bells,sound,sequence,audio memory,tones",Identify each bell’s individual tone first (which bell is high/low).,Break the sequence into chunks (2–3 tones) and repeat them.,Use pitch and rhythm as anchors to remember order.,"If you miss a tone, re-listen from the start and tackle it slowly.",https://youtube.com/shorts/49JLGtVF5uc?feature=share,3,5,
room2_puzzle1,Room 2,Mushroom Light Reaction (Starter),Large red-capped mushroom on a pedestal with lit holes on the cap. Players must place tokens or tap spots as they light across 3 levels; completing this activates the room.,"mushroom,lights,starter,levels,timer",This puzzle must be completed to unlock other puzzles in the room — focus on it first.,Watch which holes light and tap those spots quickly; speed matters but stay calm.,Complete each level one at a time — do not skip a lit hole.,"If time runs out, pause and memorize the pattern before retrying.",https://youtu.be/oMhbzOo0c3s,4,3,
room2_puzzle2,Room 2,Shelf with Flasks (Wand Controls),"A cabinet with two shelves, three flasks per shelf (dirty glass). A large blue dreamcatcher on the wall shows the target arrangement. A wand touches three dots to cycle/swap flask positions.","flasks,colors,wand,swap,sequence,dreamcatcher","Observe how each wand tap affects the flasks (dot 1 shifts line1, dot 2 swaps ends, dot 3 shifts line2).","Work line-by-line — get the first row correct, then adjust the second.",Use the dreamcatcher center pattern as the exact target — match colors and order.,"If a tap does something unexpected, try the other control dots to see their effect before undoing.",https://youtu.be/oMhbzOo0c3s,4,6,room2_puzzle1
room2_puzzle3,Room 2,Magic of Elements (Combination Console),Horizontal oval console with elemental icons around a thunderstorm image in the center. Pairing elements produces new elements until the Thunderstorm is created.,"elements,combination,logic,oval,thunderstorm","Start by combining basic elements (Air, Fire, Water, Earth) and observe what new elements light up.","Look for etched clues showing valid combos; Energy = Air + Fire, Lava = Fire + Earth, Rock = Lava + Water, Metal = Rock + Fire, etc.",Don’t brute-force every pair — use clues and build intermediates methodically.,"Once intermediate elements appear, use them to form Storm/Electric combinations needed for Thunderstorm.",https://youtu.be/oMhbzOo0c3s,4,6,room2_puzzle1
room2_puzzle4,Room 2,Distaff Wheel Alignment,A wooden wheel mounted on a table between posts; painted images on its back are visible via a small keyhole. The dreamcatcher outer ring shows symbol sequences to match by rotating and holding the wheel in place.,"wheel,distaff,keyhole,alignment,dreamcatcher,symbols",Look through the keyhole on the back to see the painted images you must match.,Rotate the wheel slowly and hold it when you think it matches — you should hear a 'ding' to confirm.,The dreamcatcher’s outer ring gives the sequence; repeat that sequence on the wheel.,"If the confirmation passes then resets, you may have not held long enough — hold for about a second.",https://youtu.be/oMhbzOo0c3s,3,4,room2_puzzle1
room3_puzzle1,Room 3,Glowing Triangle (Corner Rotations),Triangle-shaped table with a triangular array of buttons/lights; three corner controls rotate adjacent hexagon/orientation pieces. Goal: get all center lights green forming a triangle.,"triangle,rotation,lights,corner controls,hexagon",Press one corner control once to see which small hexagons it rotates — observe before making multiple moves.,"Work to position one green toward the center, then use adjacent corner rotations to complete the center triangle.",Avoid random rotations; plan which corner affects which hexagon.,"If you undo something, remember which corner produced the last change to reverse it.",https://youtu.be/uplOYk8xBkM,3,5,
room3_puzzle2,Room 3,Magnet Labyrinth (Track & Ball),A transparent shallow box contains a metal ball and an overhead magnet/wand. Moving the wand guides the ball through carved pathways; lights on edges indicate progress.,"magnet,labyrinth,ball,track,wand,edge lights",Hold the wand close and move it slowly — sudden moves make the ball jump unpredictably.,Use the edge lights as feedback: move the ball to the lit edge to register progress.,Sometimes gentle tilts and steady pacing are better than force.,"If the ball is stuck, try moving the wand back slightly to disengage and then proceed more slowly.",https://youtu.be/uplOYk8xBkM,3,4,
room3_puzzle3,Room 3,Molecule Color Match (Cylindrical Panel),A cylinder with many small color-changing balls and a screen that displays the current target pattern. Pressing controls cycles colors of balls; must match the screen pattern.,"molecule,color cycles,cylinder,screen,pattern",Watch the screen for the target pattern — it updates periodically.,Cycle one group at a time and compare to the target; don’t change multiple groups at once.,"If the screen cycles slowly, wait for it to display the exact target before making a final adjustment.",Use consistent order when testing (left-to-right or top-to-bottom) to avoid losing track.,https://youtu.be/uplOYk8xBkM,3,5,
room3_puzzle4,Room 3,Connect the Dots Logic Grid (5x8),A 5×8 grid of square buttons controlled by five directional buttons (left/right/up/down/none). Clues (a cross on a flask + floor paper mapping to professor images with indices) indicate starting point and which preset picture index to use to find the start.,"grid,connect,dots,logic,starting index,flask clue",Look for the cross under the flask and match it to the floor paper — that tells you where to start.,Use the professor images index (the picture number) to find the starting cell and orientation.,Plan a path on paper before committing; avoid moves that would trap you.,"If one path fails, try the next candidate image instead of random guessing.",https://youtu.be/uplOYk8xBkM,4,8,
room4_puzzle1,Room 4,Emergency Startup Cabinet,"Wall-mounted cabinet with labeled switches (T1..T3 etc.), wires, numbered holes, buttons, and levers. Inside door shows a printed 'Emergency Startup' sequence to follow exactly.","cabinet,switches,wires,lever,sequence,instructions",Read the emergency startup instructions on the inside of the cabinet fully before interacting.,Follow each step in order — missing one will reset the system.,Double-check wire positions and lever orientation against the printed diagram.,"If unsure, restart from step 1 calmly and work slowly.",https://youtu.be/8xl81FsZH8Q,3,6,
room4_puzzle2,Room 4,Metal Rod (Insulation Challenge),A metal wire maze mounted on a board. Players guide a ring/handle along the maze without touching the metal. Touching it loses a life. Insulating material (skeleton's scarf) is available elsewhere in the room.,"metalrod,wire maze,insulation,scarf,steady hand",Find the scarf on the skeleton and use it as insulation before attempting the maze.,Move very slowly and keep the ring parallel to the maze surface to avoid accidental touches.,"If you touch the wire, pause and re-evaluate your angle — sometimes a tiny rotation helps.",Preserve your lives by taking short practice runs along easier sections first.,https://youtu.be/8xl81FsZH8Q,5,8,
room4_puzzle3,Room 4,Fast Colours (Paired Panels),Two small rectangular panels each with 8 buttons; pulling or holding a button on one panel shows a color on the paired panel. Players must map and set the main panel to match colors quickly.,"fast colors,paired panels,buttons,color mapping,reaction","Pull the lever/button on the left panel to reveal the color, then set the corresponding control on the right.",Remember the color cycle order so you don't overshoot (check panel behavior).,Work methodically — match one color fully before moving to the next.,"If you accidentally cycle past the target, cycle forward the full loop to return to it.",https://youtu.be/8xl81FsZH8Q,3,4,
room4_puzzle4,Room 4,Fast Buttons (2-player Hold & Press),A 2×6 array of light-up buttons. Players must press and HOLD certain buttons while pressing other lit buttons in sequence. Often requires two players to hold multiple buttons simultaneously.,"fast buttons,hold,teamwork,press and hold,buttons",Assign one player to hold and one to press the next buttons — coordination is key.,Remember to HOLD a pressed button; tapping is not enough.,Reposition hands for comfort and use knuckles/elbows if needed for extra holds.,"If timing fails, pause, reset, and re-establish a rhythm before retrying.",https://youtu.be/8xl81FsZH8Q,4,5,
